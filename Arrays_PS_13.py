Two Sum : Check if a pair with given sum exists in Array
Problem Statement: Given an array of integers arr[] and an integer target.
1st variant: Return YES if there exist two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, return NO.
2nd variant: Return indices of the two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, we will return {-1, -1}.
Input: N = 5, arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}, target = 14
Output : YES
Explanation: arr[1] + arr[3] = 14. So, the answer is “YES” for first variant for second variant output will be : [1,3].

Input: N = 5, arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}, target = 15
Output : NO.
Explanation: There exist no such two numbers whose sum is equal to the target.
